- Login does all automatic choose previous logged in account, we need to decide which account we want to use
- Make register more clear on address that user need to select an address 
- In register page the select bank has as default value also his label.... (when input is empty on first time opened)
- create service dialog contains an scroll overflow when to small in vertical size 
- 400 bad request need to be handled in the frontend on the snackbar redux:
    Remove for example: 'setValue("id", service.id);' from the GarageServiceDialog that is required on update.

<h1>AutoHelper: THINKS ABOUT</h1>
