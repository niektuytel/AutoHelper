<h1>AutoHelper: BUGS</h1>
- Login does all automatic choose previous logged in account, we need to decide which account we want to use
- Use Bicep for ARM templates
- Required to use 'ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT': 'Development' in configurations to run 
and get access to swagger + api endpoints, otherwise it does not work
- If the garage image changed, the old image is still in the blob storage, we need to delete it (+ the tumbnail)
